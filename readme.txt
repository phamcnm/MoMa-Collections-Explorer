STATUS:
- Everything on index.html works (all the searching functionality), except that the graph does not display anything.
- The API endpoints to search for artists and artworks work.
- The API endpoints for a specific artist/artwork, work, but we have not implemented a way to display them.
- The api endpoint for the graph works. The graph code has been attempted but not finished.
